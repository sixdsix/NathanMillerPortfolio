      <h1 class="flex-item">Hello! My name is Nathan, I'm a software developer based in Los Angeles, CA!</h1>
      <br>
      <p class="flex-item">I am fascinated by software engineering and the facets that fall into software development.
        I currently hold and Interim Secret Security Clearance for my work with Northrup Grumman as a Software Engineer
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>As a recent graduate from Chapman University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in
        Information Security & Policy, I bring a passion for innovation and a dedication to mastering the complexities
        of technology. </p>
      <br>
      <p>With a solid GPA of 3.785, I've not only excelled in my academic pursuits but have also delved
        into various technical domains and hands-on experiences that have shaped my expertise. </p>

          Automata to
          Deterministic Finite Automata Converter</a></h1>
      <br>
      <p class="flex-item">The coding project aims to streamline the conversion process of non-deterministic finite
        automata (NFA) into deterministic finite automata (DFA).
        NFAs often pose challenges due to their non-deterministic nature, making them less efficient for practical
        applications.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The project employs algorithms to systematically analyze the NFA structure and generate equivalent DFAs. By
        eliminating non-determinism, the resulting DFAs offer improved efficiency and clarity in representing language
        recognition processes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This project bridges theoretical concepts in automata theory with practical programming implementation,
        facilitating easier comprehension and utilization of finite automata in various computational tasks.</p>

          Student/Faculty Database</a></h1>
      <br>
      <p class="flex-item">The coding project integrates a SQL database with Python to create a robust student-faculty
        database system. This system offers key functionalities including displaying all students and their attributes,
        adding new students, updating student information, deleting student records, and searching for specific
        students.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> By leveraging the connection between Python and SQL, users can efficiently manage student data with ease and
        accuracy.</p>
      <br>
      <p> This project enhances data management capabilities, facilitating streamlined operations for educational
        institutions
        or any entity requiring organized student information. </p>

          Brothers Game Simulation</a></h1>
      <br>
      <p class="flex-item">I completed a Super Mario Bros.-themed simulation in C++, adhering to provided guidelines.
        The program simulates
        Mario's progress through levels, encountering enemies and collecting coins.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>It reads input from a text file to set up the game world and logs Mario's actions, including position, power
        level, and interactions. We used primitive arrays
        for data storage as required, and collaborated with a partner to ensure compliance with the assignment's
        specifications. </p>
      <br>
      <p>This project provided valuable experience in C++ development and file processing techniques while
        engaging with a classic gaming concept. </p>
